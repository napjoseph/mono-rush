If you manage multiple projects across different GitHub Organizations, you may have faced a common scenario: the need to copy [GitHub issue labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) from one repository to another. It used to be a manual process before, but luckily we can now use [GitHub's official CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

## Why copy issue labels?

Here are some common scenarios when you might need to copy issue labels between projects:

- **Standardization**: If your Organization requires a standard list of issue labels for all projects, copying issue labels from an existing project with the required labels ensures consistency.
- **Project Migration**: When a project is moved from one Organization to another, you might want to retain the issue labels to maintain the same workflow and issue categorization.
- **Team Collaboration**: If multiple teams within an Organization work on similar projects, having a unified set of issue labels for better collaboration and understanding across teams is helpful.

## Using the GitHub CLI

Before we dive into the process, make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, head to https://cli.github.com/ and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

You can authenticate with the CLI using:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Once you have the GitHub CLI installed and configured, you can copy issue labels between repositories by executing the following command:

```bash
gh label clone owner-name/source-repo-name --repo owner-name/destination-repo-name --force
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `gh`: The GitHub CLI command.
- `label`: The command group for working with issue labels.
- `clone`: The command to copy labels from one repository to another.
- `owner-name/source-repo-name`: The source repository from which you want to copy the issue labels.
- `--repo`: The flag to specify the destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.
- `owner-name/destination-repo-name`: The destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.
- `--force`: Optional flag to overwrite existing labels in the destination repository.

Documentation for the command can be found at https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_clone.

> **NOTE**: Please note that you must have the necessary permissions (write access) for the destination repositories.

Once the command executes successfully, all issue labels from `owner-name/source-repo-name` will be copied to `owner-name/destination-repo-name`, ensuring that the latter now follows the Organization's standard list of issue labels.

## Creating default labels for your Organization

As an Organization owner, you can also create default labels that will be automatically included in every new repository in your Organization. This is a convenient way to standardize issue labels across all projects within your Organization.

Please refer to the GitHub documentation on [Managing Default Labels for Repositories in Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization) for detailed instructions and screenshots.

> **NOTE**: Adding, editing, or deleting a default label does not affect existing repositories. Default labels only apply to new repositories created after the changes.
